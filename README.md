This took me 3.5 hours to complete. 
I struggled with counting correct answer. I originally wanted to create an empty array that I pushed into everytime the user got a right answer. I ended up just declaring an int called counter in each method and iterating it when they got it right.
I was confident in selective statements because they're the easiest to grasp.
I learned that it's difficult/not possible to push into an array from another method!
I utilized the Microsoft docs, Google, and Stack Overflow.
